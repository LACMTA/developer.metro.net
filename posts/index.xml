      <description>Introduction Each piece can be placed on a continuum, with art on one end and data visualization on the other, and ranging between adjectives: ambiguous/concrete, personal/public, intuitive/objective, informational/emotional. No matter where the maps fall, their creators are communicating underlying verities—whether evidence-based truths or more pliant, relative “truths”—about life in an endlessly fascinating and dynamic metropolis.

Data Artist-in-Residence Vision Metro posits that artists are well-positioned to synthesize diverse facts, goals, data and references, reveal new frames, connections and meaning and speak across “languages” as it applies to problem-solving, knowledge creation, and enhancing the user experience for Metro.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
