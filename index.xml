      <description>Introduction Each piece can be placed on a continuum, with art on one end and data visualization on the other, and ranging between adjectives: ambiguous/concrete, personal/public, intuitive/objective, informational/emotional. No matter where the maps fall, their creators are communicating underlying verities—whether evidence-based truths or more pliant, relative “truths”—about life in an endlessly fascinating and dynamic metropolis.

Data Artist-in-Residence Vision Metro posits that artists are well-positioned to synthesize diverse facts, goals, data and references, reveal new frames, connections and meaning and speak across “languages” as it applies to problem-solving, knowledge creation, and enhancing the user experience for Metro.</description>

      <description>Metro Bus Line Shapefiles The Metro Bus Line Zip File contains 5 shapefiles that cover all Metro Bus Lines. A shapefile is a set of 3 to 7 interrelated files that can be used with mapping (GIS) software. These technical files that have no other application; you must have GIS software to use them. The shapefiles are redrawn every six months, typically in June and December. We’ll try to post them within six weeks of changes.</description>

      <description>Metro Nextrip API Metro’s Realtime Application Programming Interface (API) lives at http://api.metro.net/. It gives you access to the positions of Metro vehicles on their routes in real time.
The Realtime API is a RESTful web service designed to serve bus location data gathered by our Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS) and the new Nextrip prediction engine. This is the result of years of difficult work refining the information we collect from the GPS trackers on every bus.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
