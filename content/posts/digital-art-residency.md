## Introduction

*Each piece can be placed on a continuum, with art on one end and data visualization on the other, and ranging between adjectives: ambiguous/concrete, personal/public, intuitive/objective, informational/emotional. No matter where the maps fall, their creators are communicating underlying verities—whether evidence-based truths or more pliant, relative “truths”—about life in an endlessly fascinating and dynamic metropolis.*

# Data Artist-in-Residence 

## Vision
Metro posits that artists are well-positioned to synthesize diverse facts, goals, data and references, reveal new frames, connections and meaning and speak across “languages” as it applies to problem-solving, knowledge creation, and enhancing the user experience for Metro. The residency program’s primary goal is to infuse artists into the daily work of the Metro staff and public as we and develop innovative strategies to improve the customer experience and expand access to public transportation across Los Angeles County.

## Pilot Project
A small scale, pilot project will test the potential and viability for a formal Metro Artist in Residence where by artist(s) will be invited to respond to specific needs, challenges and opportunities across Metro departments and disciplines with an inquiry, research, visual, interactive and project-based approach. 

## Artist Objectives
Work across the Metro Communications, Customer Service and Information and Technology Services Departments to evaluate existing Metro Platform (web services and data) and propose new web-based and in-person engagement strategies to increase internal and external awareness of and customer access to Metro’s web services and data resources.

## Potential interfaces
Metro Platform (web services and data), 3rd Floor Screens, Map cases 

Engage with staff of the Metro Communications, Customer Services and Information and Technology Services Departments, with opportunities to identify and capitalize on collaborative opportunities. 

## Artist Honoraria
$5,000 three months at 80 hours/month ($20/hour) 

## Artist Skills
- Strong interdisciplinary art practice.
- Ability to evaluate data, data sources and infrastructure critically.
- Ability to respond to data creatively. 
- Strong team collaborator.
- Experience working in and with communities and developing projects in response to needs, opportunities and community engagement.

Recognizing the diversity of artistic process employed by artists, the plan should be tailored to the artist’s distinct practice: 
    
### Artistic inquiry— 
Utilizing creative research and data gathering methods to inform concept development for data interpretation.

### Audience/colleague participation— 
Testing methods of gleaning and visualizing/deploying information. 

## Specific Deliverables

Propose a minimum of two “site-specific” interventions utilizing Metro Platform (web services and data) and/or exploring intersections between Metro departments.

## Criteria for interventions may include:

- Enhance the user experience and/or staff experience;
- Reveal new knowledge to Metro;
- Proposes a new approach to collaboration; and 
- Proposes a new approach to experiencing data
